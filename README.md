## 📖 About  
This repo contains a **full sample website** inspired by the Coca-Cola brand — built as a frontend practice project to recreate a modern, responsive marketing site layout. The goal was to practice layout composition, responsive techniques, hero sections, marketing blocks, grid/gallery sections, and CSS animations while keeping the code clean and maintainable.

**Important:** This project is a fan-made sample for learning and demonstration only. It is **not affiliated** with or endorsed by The Coca-Cola Company. All brand assets used (logos, images, copy) are for educational/sample purposes only.
